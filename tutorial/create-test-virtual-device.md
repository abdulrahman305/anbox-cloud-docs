# Create and test a virtual device

> Before you start, complete: {ref}`tut-installing-appliance` but when initializing, remember to answer *Yes* to the question: *Do you want to setup access to the AMS API for your current user (ubuntu, uid=1000)?*

In this tutorial, we will go through the first steps of using Anbox Cloud to create a virtual Android device. By *virtual device*, we mean a simulated device that runs a plain Android operating system without any special apps installed. Anbox Cloud treats such a virtual device as an *empty* application, meaning an application that is not running a specific APK.

By the end of this tutorial, we will be familiar with an {term}`Application` and an {term}`Instance` in Anbox Cloud that are used to create and stream the virtual Android device.

This tutorial has two paths - you can use the CLI or the dashboard, depending on your learning goals. The CLI is more powerful and gives you access to all features of Anbox Cloud, while the dashboard is a simpler user interface. For this tutorial, it does not matter which path you choose.

We will use the {term}`Anbox Management Client (AMC)` in this tutorial to work with applications and instances. AMC communicates with the {term}`Anbox Management Service (AMS)`, the management module of Anbox Cloud.

## Create the device

The first step is to create a `yaml` file that can be used as the application manifest. It is important that this file is created in your `home` directory.

In the home directory, let's first create a directory for the application content:

      mkdir my-app

This directory is the location where the application manifest file and any relevant APK must reside.

For this tutorial, we are going to create a device with a plain Android operating system and so we don't need an APK. Let's create a simple `manifest.yaml` inside the `my-app` directory with the following contents:

```yaml
name: my-first-app
resources:
   cpus: 4
   memory: 4GB
   disk-size: 3GB
```

Now, let's create the application:

      amc application create my-app/

`my-app/` is the application directory where the manifest and any other application related artifacts are available.

The application is created and bootstrapped. Now, to see the application details and its status, run:

      amc application list

Watch the output of this command till the application becomes *ready*.

## Test the virtual device

**Launch an instance**

When the application is *ready*, let's launch an instance:

      amc launch my-first-app --vm --enable-streaming

This command creates and starts an instance for the application.

`my-first-app` is the application name, you can also use the application ID to launch an instance for it.

The `--enable-streaming` flag indicates that we want to stream this instance.

The `--vm` flag indicates that we want to create the application inside a virtual machine instance instead of the default container instance.

To see the instance details and its status, run:

      amc ls

When the instance status reaches the *running* status, let's try to access it. We will need to copy the instance ID from the previous command's output.

      amc shell instance_id

This takes us into the Linux instance that runs the Android container. Next, let's try accessing the nested Android container:

      anbox-shell

Now, we are inside the Android container. Play around by running some of the following commands:

      ls
      logcat
      exit

`exit` or pressing Control+D takes us back to the Linux container.

**Update an application**

We can have several versions of an application. Let's try and update the application:

Go to the application directory and create a new manifest. This manifest introduces a change to the disk-size and also has a tag to associate with the application.

```yaml
name: my-first-app
resources:
   cpus: 4
   memory: 4GB
   disk-size: 8GB
tags:
   game
```

Now, run the following commands and observe the output:

      amc application update my-first-app my-app/
      amc application list
      amc application show my-first-app

The `list` command displays the list of applications available. As an application becomes *active*, it is automatically published and a new version of the `my-first-app` is created.

The `show` command displays the application information along with its versions.

Now if we launch our application without explicitly specifying a version, our latest published version will be considered.

**Streaming the application**

To look at a visual output of the stream-enabled instance that we created, we need a stream client.You can set up your own stream client by following the {ref}`tut-set-up-stream-client` later. For this tutorial, you can use the default client, the Anbox Cloud dashboard.

Go to `https://machine-address` using a browser and go to the *Instances* page where we can see the instance we created. See the *Dashboard* tab for details on using the dashboard to test the virtual device.

## Success!
You now know how to use the command line to create and test an Android virtual device in Anbox Cloud.

````{group-tab} Dashboard

## Create the device

The first step is to create an application. Let's go to the dashboard and then *Applications* > *Create Application*.

The next step is to give our application, a name: *my-application*.

We can select whether we want to create the application in a container or a virtual machine. For this tutorial, let's select *Container*.

Then, we can select the Android image. Observe that the image can be identified if it is an Android (AOSP) or an Android automotive (AAOS) image by looking at the image names. Let's select `jammy:android14:amd64` which is an Ubuntu 22.04 based Android 14 image for AMD64 architecture.

Next, let's select the resource type. We can leave it to the default value for this tutorial.

Finally, we have a choice to upload an Android APK. It is not mandatory to have an APK because we can still create and interact with the plain Android operating system. For this tutorial, we are not uploading an APK. However, if you wish to test your Android application, this is where you upload its APK.

The dashboard allows for more configuration through the *Configuration* options. Some attributes that can be configured include the boot package, boot activity, enabling the watchdog, stopping auto-updates and more. These options are also dependent on whether we uploaded an APK. For this tutorial, we can safely ignore these options.

There is a `Customize manifest.yaml` option to configure the attributes of the application. You can learn about the different attributes that are available at {ref}`ref-application-manifest` later but for now, the default manifest file will work.

Click *Create* and watch the *Applications* page as our application gets initialized. While waiting for the application to be ready, you can click on the application name and explore the application details.

## Test the device

**Launch an instance**

Now, we need an instance that can be streamed to test our Android virtual device. 

The *Create instance* button becomes available when the application is *ready*. Let's click *Create instance*.

While creating the instance, we can observe some interesting behaviors:

- It is possible to create an instance from an image instead of an application. If you want to learn more about the different types of instances, you can later refer to {ref}`sec-application-raw-instances`.
- Some of the details are pre-populated based on the context of our application.
- There can be multiple versions of an application and an instance can be based on any of the active versions.

To test our virtual device quickly, all we have to do for now, is to provide a name to the instance and click *Create and start*.

Watch the *Instances* page as the instance is quickly created and started.

**Stream the application**

You will notice that even after the instance is started, we cannot stream it yet - the stream icon(![stream icon](/images/icons/stream-icon.png)) is not enabled yet. This is because the instance needs to reach a *running* status before it can be streamed.

Once the status turns to *running*, click the stream icon.

Before the stream starts, there may be a warning from your browser to accept the certificates manually. This is because the dashboard uses self-signed certificates. Accept the certificate and reload the page.

 Now, you should be able to interact with the Android virtual device. If we had used an APK, the application interface would be visible directly.

On the stream page, we can see options for:

- Sharing the stream with others
- Setting up an authenticated connection using the Android Debug Bridge (ADB)
- Viewing the network, audio and video statistics for the stream
- Setting the location for a maps application
- A *Developer tools* toggle that offers access to the Ubuntu and Android instances. For example, if you are performing an resource intensive operation in your Android stream, you can monitor its impact using this terminal.

Let's try a simple operation of sharing our stream: Click *Set up sharing*, give your share a title and an expiry date.

When we click *Set up*, we are provided with a URL to our Android stream that can be shared.

**Simulate a failure in the instance**

If we click on our instance name, we can explore the instance details, interact with it using a terminal and view logs for debugging.

This terminal is the shell for the Linux instance that runs the Android container. You can run commands in the Linux instance, or you can type `anbox-shell` and to gain access to the nested Android container. 

The `exit` command takes you back from the Android container shell to the Linux instance shell.

Let us simulate a failure for the instance. In the *Terminal* tab of the instance, run:

      amsctl notify-status error --message="My error message"

As you watch the instance status turn to *error*, you can also see logs being generated. Click on the *Logs* tab and explore the different types of logs available.

When you are done, click *Start* at the top right to return the instance to the running status.

## Success!

You now know how to use the Anbox Cloud dashboard to create and test an Android virtual device.
