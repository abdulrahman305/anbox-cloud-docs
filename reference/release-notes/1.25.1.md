# 1.25.1

These release notes cover new features and changes in Anbox Cloud 1.25.1.

Anbox Cloud 1.25.1 is a patch release. To understand minor and patch releases, see [Release notes](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/anbox-cloud/en/latest/reference/release-notes/release-notes).

Please see [Component versions](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/anbox-cloud/en/latest/reference/component-versions/) for a list of updated components.

## Requirements

See the [Requirements](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/anbox-cloud/en/latest/reference/requirements/) for details on general and deployment specific requirements to run Anbox Cloud.

## New features & improvements

### Charms

* All our charms are reworked to use the [Operator Framework](https://github.com/canonical/operator). The new charms use different configuration attributes. For more information, see {ref}`ref-charm-configuration`.  

Starting this release, the default channel for the LXD snap has changed to 5.21/stable. If you are running LXD clusters with the LXD snap tracking a channel which is different than 5.21/stable, it is important to set the charm configuration item `channel` *explicitly* to the currently used channel before scaling up or down.  

The upgrade path for the LXD charm since 1.25.1 is different from the upgrade path in earlier versions. The instructions for both paths are available at {ref}`howto-upgrade-anbox-cloud`.

* The dashboard charm now provides actions for creating and restoring backups of the dashboard data. We will be supporting backup and restore across all charms in the future releases.
* The AAR charm can now remove client certificates from its trust store when the relation with another charm is removed.
* Initial support for [Grafana Tempo](https://grafana.com/oss/tempo/) for all Anbox Cloud charms using the `ops` framework.
* The LXD charm provides the public address of the machine when AMS adds a node, instead of having to explicitly set it through the relation for the AMS charm.

### Other
* Android security updates for March 2025 (see [Android Security Bulletin - March 2025](https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2025-03-01)).
* The Android WebView has been updated to 133.0.6943.121.

## Deprecations

The following deprecations are announced as part of the 1.25.1 release. See {ref}`ref-deprecation-notes` for more information on when the support for these items will be dropped:

* Juju 2.9

## Bug fixes

* [LP 2100576](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2100576) If an app was created in a deployment running a version of Anbox Cloud that is earlier than 1.25.0, it couldn't be updated after upgrading to the 1.25.0 version.
* [LP 2099983](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2099983) Since 1.25.0, Anbox runtime doesn't recognize the metrics server specified in `/var/lib/anbox/session.json`.
* [LP 2098835](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2098835) With a charmed Anbox Cloud deployment where the AMS charm is upgraded from 1.24.0 to 1.25.0, a `image not found` error occurs when you try to create an application.    
* [LP 2097809](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2097809) The deletion operation for sharing a session doesn't wait for completion.
* [LP 2097753](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2097753) The charms on the `1.25/beta` channel do not reflect the correct public IP address.
* [LP 2097743](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2097743) `anbox_sync` kernel module is not loaded by the LXD charm.
* [LP 2097741](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2097741) Before 1.25.0, the LXD charm had support to set the LXD node's failure domain based on the value of `JUJU_AVAILABILITY_ZONE`. This was not possible with the 1.25.0 charm leading to AMS assuming an incorrect placement of nodes across availability zones and potentially cause unexpected down time.
* [LP 2097749](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2097749) When AMS is configured by the AAR charm with a certificate and fingerprint for accessing the application registry, it does not internally reload the certificate for validating the AAR endpoint and results in an error.
* [LP 2097742](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2097742) When cluster members are no longer available, the LXD charm fails to remove them forcefully.
* [LP 2093904](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2093904) Setting a top or bottom value for the `verticalAlignment` option of the streaming SDK doesn't work as expected.
* [LP 2077598](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2077598) When the dashboard requests camera access, but no camera is available, the stream stops and the dashboard displays a `camera not found` error.
* [LP 2091636](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2091636) The example in the AMS API for `/1.0/instances/{id_or_name}/exec` incorrectly shows that the `command` field expects a string while it is actually expecting an array.
* [LP 2068690](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2068690) Prometheus collects invalid instance boot up times.
* [LP 2091609](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2091609) Private bug
