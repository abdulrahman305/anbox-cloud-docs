## Bug fixes

The following bug fixes are available as part of this release:

* [LP 2115297](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2115297) After upgrading to version 1.26.0 or later, streaming a session did not work for deployments with an NVIDIA GPU.
* [LP 2114967](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2114967) With multiple Android users, setting [`enable_virtual_keyboard`](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/anbox-cloud/reference/feature-flags/#enable-virtual-keyboard) or [`enable_anbox_ime`](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/anbox-cloud/reference/feature-flags/#enable-anbox-ime) feature flags fails. When set, the feature will be enabled, but starting Anbox results in a timeout the values are not set for the correct user.
* [LP 2114227](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2114227) When deploying with Terraform, when the Anbox kernel modules package is installed, an Ubuntu Pro token is required. However, attaching an Ubuntu Pro token is no longer mandatory to complete the deployment.
* [LP 2115938](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2115938) When joining an existing session, if the resolution has width or height as an odd number, the session is aborted and the Anbox instance end up with an error status.
This issue occurs only when the [join API](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/anbox-cloud/reference/api-reference/gateway-api/#/session/handle-join-session) is used with a resolution that has width or height as an odd number.
* [LP 2112351](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2112351) The deployment fails with the LXD unit in error status. If you run `juju status`, you could see an error similar to: `unit-lxd/0* error idle hook failed: "config-changed"`.
* Dashboard bug fixes:
    * [LP 2101043](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2101043) The dashboard's *Images* page displayed a misaligned pagination footer.
    * [LP 2112098](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2112098) While upgrading from 1.25.2 to 1.26.0, the dashboard displays the error `Ubuntu Pro token is not attached` even when the Ubuntu Pro token is already attached.
    * [LP 2112538](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2112538) When using Firefox, the dashboard's *Statistics* page does not show any RTT time.
    * [LP 2101027](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2101027) When using the dashboard, you cannot delete an instance when it is being prepared or started.
    * [LP 2101031](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2101031) Application-based instances don't have a link to the application in their *Details* page.
    * [LP 2101040](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2101040) When using Safari, the list of images on the dashboard seems to have more pages when there is just one page.
    * [LP 2101045](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2101045) On smaller screen sizes, opening the side navigation causes the pagination input to break into multiple lines.                                                         

**The following bugs were known issues in 1.26.1 and are fixed with this release:**

* [LP 2112542](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2112542) Occasionally, when creating or deleting instances in a quick succession, an instance doesn't start. Instead, you see this error:

        Failed start validation for device "eth0": IP address "192.168.96.5" already defined on another NIC

* [LP 2114950](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2114950) Even when the screen orientation is changed by the Android application, the device's [runtime configuration](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/runtime-changes) does not change.
* [LP 2113771](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2113771) When upgrading charms from 1.26.0 to 1.26.1, the AMS node controller ends up in an error state.
