Anbox Cloud 1.27.0 is a minor release. To understand minor and patch releases, see [Release notes](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/anbox-cloud/en/latest/reference/release-notes/release-notes).

Please see [Component versions](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/anbox-cloud/en/latest/reference/component-versions/) for a list of updated components.

## Requirements

See the [Requirements](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/anbox-cloud/en/latest/reference/requirements/) for details on general and deployment specific requirements to run Anbox Cloud.

## New features & improvements

### Authentication and authorization

In addition to connection to a remote AMS using mutual TLS, you can now use OIDC based authentication for both web and command line clients. OIDC based authentication offers the ability to store a user identity in Anbox Cloud. See {ref}`howto-access-ams-remote` for more information.

```{important}
For command line clients, this feature is an alpha release and still in active development. The interfaces and APIs will undergo changes in the next few releases.
```

### Dashboard

* System administrators have a new *Operations* page to monitor all asynchronous, long-running operations. This page provides all information that you can obtain when running `amc operation ls`.
* A notification center that displays queued notifications is available. These notifications are persistent until dismissed and can be filtered.

### Other

* The Android WebView has been updated to [138.0.7204.179](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2025/07/chrome-for-android-update_29.html).

## Deprecations and removed functionality

* Support for Juju 2.9 was deprecated in 1.25.1 and is removed with this release. Instead, upgrade to the latest Juju version, 3.6. See {ref}`sec-juju-version-requirements` for more information.
* Support for kernels older than 6.8 was deprecated in 1.25.0 and is removed with this release.
