# 1.23.2

These release notes cover new features and changes in Anbox Cloud 1.23.2.

Anbox Cloud 1.23.2 is a patch release. To understand minor and patch releases, see {ref}`ref-release-notes`.

Please see {ref}`ref-component-versions` for a list of updated components.

## Requirements

See the {ref}`ref-requirements` for details on general and deployment specific requirements to run Anbox Cloud.

## New features & improvements

* Android security updates for October 2024 (see [Android Security Bulletin - October 2024](https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2024-10-01) for more information).
* The Android WebView has been updated to [129.0.6668.81](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2024/10/chrome-for-android-update.html).

## Known issues

* Since version 1.23.0, the Anbox WebRTC Data Proxy service starts on demand rather than at container startup. However, its startup time may take longer than expected, which can negatively impact the {ref}`out-of-band data exchange <howto-exchange-oob-data>` between the WebRTC server and client. This issue can be worked around by applying the following tweak in a [pre-start hook](https://anbox-cloud.io/docs/ref/hooks).

  ```
  #!/bin/sh -ex
  if  [ "$CONTAINER_TYPE" = "regular" ]; then
    exit 0
  fi

  DROP_IN_DIR=/etc/systemd/system/anbox-webrtc-data-proxy.service.d/
  sudo mkdir -p "${DROP_IN_DIR}"
  sudo tee "${DROP_IN_DIR}/override.conf" > /dev/null <<EOF
  [Install]
  WantedBy=multi-user.target
  EOF

  sudo systemctl daemon-reload
  sudo systemctl enable anbox-webrtc-data-proxy
  ```
