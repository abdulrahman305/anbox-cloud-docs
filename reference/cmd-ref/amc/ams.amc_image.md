Manage images

### Synopsis

Manage images.

Images are the base for a container running in Anbox Cloud and contain everything
necessary to properly run an Android application in a container.

Images can be provided manually or via an image server. You can add, update or
delete them from AMS.

See https://documentation.ubuntu.com/anbox-cloud/en/latest/reference/provided-images/ and
https://documentation.ubuntu.com/anbox-cloud/en/latest/howto/anbox/manage-images/ for more information.
