# Anbox Stream Agent

Anbox Streaming Agent is using cryptographic technology for:

* TLS transport encryption
* Mutual TLS based authentication
* Token based authentication

## TLS transport encryption

All network endpoints exposed by the Anbox Stream Agent are secured with TLS using an 4096 bit RSA key. The Anbox Stream Agent strictly enforces TLS 1.3 or better and does not provide backward compatibility with older TLS versions.

## Mutual TLS based authentication

The Anbox Stream Agent uses mutual TLS authentication to establish a trusted TLS communication channel with AMS to call its API. For this it generates a TLS certificate using an 4096 bit RSA key.

In order to exchange messages with the Anbox Stream Gateway through the [NATS](https://nats.io/) message queue, the Anbox Stream Agent uses a CA certificated signed by a 4096 bit RSA key to ensure trust with the NATS server.

## Token based authentication

Individual Anbox instances have access to a limited set of API endpoints exposed by the Anbox Stream Agent to receive commands or exchange WebRTC signaling information with a connecting client. Access is authenticated by a scope-limited [Macaroon](http://theory.stanford.edu/~ataly/Papers/macaroons.pdf) based token. The token is signed with a [HMAC](https://www.okta.com/identity-101/hmac/) using SHA-256 (HS256) and a 64 byte secret key. The [`macaroon.New`](https://pkg.go.dev/gopkg.in/macaroon.v2@v2.1.0#New) method is used internally to generate the JWT token.

For authentication purposes with the [Coturn TURN server](https://github.com/coturn/coturn) the Anbox Stream Agent generates short living authentication tokens signed with a [HMAC](https://www.okta.com/identity-101/hmac/) using SHA-1 and a 64 byte secret key. See [RFC5389](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5389#section-15.4) and the [Coturn documentation](https://github.com/coturn/coturn/blob/master/README.turnserver) for more details.
