# How to create an addon

Addons help you extend and customize your applications in Anbox Cloud. To create or update an addon, you need a specific file structure for the directory containing your addon files.

This how-to guide helps you create an addon and use it in an application.

The directory containing the addon files must also contain the following:

- The addon manifest file named `manifest.yaml`. See {ref}`ref-addon-manifest` to learn about valid keys in an addon manifest file.
- A directory named `hooks`. This directory must contain at least one executable file with a valid hook name.

Any other files in the addon directory are bundled with the addon. They can be accessed in a hook by using the `$ADDON_DIR` environment variable. See {ref}`sec-env-variables` for more information.

For example:

```bash
cat "$ADDON_DIR"/public_key.pem >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

To create an addon, you must provide the Anbox Management Client (AMC) with either of the following:
* The addon directory
* A tarball containing the required addon file structure
* A zip archive containing the required addon file structure

Let's look at an example for of an addon for enabling SSH access on a container.

## Write the addon metadata

In a new `ssh-addon` directory, create a `manifest.yaml` file with the following content:
```yaml
name: ssh
description: |
  Enable SSH access when starting a container
```

## Add a hook

In the `ssh-addon` directory, create a `hooks` directory. Hooks can be implemented in any language, this example uses a bash script.

In the `hooks` directory, create a `pre-start` file with the following content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

if [ "$INSTANCE_TYPE" = "regular" ]; then
  exit 0
fi

mkdir -p ~/.ssh
cat "$ADDON_DIR"/ssh-addon-key.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

To make the `pre-start` file executable, run the following command in the `ssh-addon` directory:

        chmod +x hooks/pre-start

```{tip}
- Supported hooks are `pre-start`, `post-start` and `post-stop`.
- Use the `INSTANCE_TYPE` variable to distinguish between regular and base instances.

See {ref}`ref-hooks` for more information.
```
Create an SSH key in your addon directory and move the private key to a location outside of the addon directory:

        ssh-keygen -f ssh-addon-key -t ecdsa -b 521
        mv ssh-addon-key ~/

Alternatively, you can use an existing key and move the public key into the addon directory and rename it as `ssh-addon-key.pub`.

## Create the addon

Your addon structure currently looks like this:

```terminal
ssh-addon
├── hooks
│   └── pre-start
├── manifest.yaml
└── ssh-addon-key.pub
```

In the parent directory of the `ssh-addon` directory, run the following command to create the addon:

        amc addon add ssh ./ssh-addon

When your addon is created, you can view it with:

        amc addon list


## Use the addon in an application

Create an application manifest file (`my-application/manifest.yaml`) and include the addon name under `addons`:

```yaml
name: my-application
resources:
  cpus: 4
  memory: 3GB
  disk-size: 3GB
addons:
  - ssh
```

Then create your application:

        application_id=$(amc application create ./my-application)
        amc wait "$application_id" -c status=ready

The `amc wait` command returns when your application is ready to launch. You can now launch an instance of your application:

        amc launch my-application --service +ssh

```{note}
SSH is one of the services that is supported without explicitly defining in the application manifest file. The SSH port 22 is closed by default. In the above command, we open the SSH port by exposing its service by using `--service`.

You can find out which ports are exposed from the _ENDPOINTS_ column in the output of the `amc ls` command. See {ref}`howto-expose-services` for more information.
```

You can now access your container via SSH:

        ssh -i ~/ssh-addon-key root@<container_ip> -p <exposed port>


```{note}
Exposed ports usually start around port 10000. `amc ls` displays the export port under the `ENDPOINTS` column.
```
