# Revoke a client

If a client gets compromised, it's important to block its access to the Anbox Application Registry (AAR) by revoking its certificate.

Revoked clients are blocked from accessing the AAR. You'll need to create a new certificate and add it manually for the client to be trusted again.

Use the following command to revoke a certificate:

    aar trust revoke <fingerprint>

```{caution}
This operation is irreversible. You cannot reverse a revocation or add the certificate again.
```
