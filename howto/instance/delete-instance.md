# Delete an instance

An instance can be deleted, which will cause any connected user to be disconnected immediately.

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} CLI
:sync: cli

Run:

    amc delete <instance_id>

Provide the ID of the instance that you want to delete.

In some cases, it is helpful to delete all instances currently available.
The `amc` command provides a `--all` flag for this, but be careful while performing a deletion of all instances.

    amc delete --all
